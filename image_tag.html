  <h2> Image Tag in Html </h3>
  <p>
    In html, img tag is used to display image/s  on the web page. A img tag is an empty tag that contains attributes only <br>like height , width, src, alt, align: center top,bottom , left , right  and, closing tags are not used in html image element.</p>
  <p><h4> src</h4>
    src is a necessary attribute and describes the source or path of the image. It tells the browser where to look for the image on the server.<br> The location of image can be on the same directory or different directory. If the  image is  saved in the same directory where the particular html is the you can simply give the name of the image inside the double quotation mark  whereas if the image is in the differnt directory from the html file then you should give the exact path name of the image otherwise the image won't be appeared in the browser. 
  
  <p><h4>alt </h4>
    We use alt attribute to show an alternate text for the image, just incase if the image can't be displayed for any reason. <br>Here the alt attrubute used to describe the image .Just incase if you wrote wrong path name or image name the name given inside the alt attribude will be visible to the users</p>
  
  <p><h4>height and width </h4>
    If you  want to give some specific  height and width for image/s  according to your requirement, then we can set it with height and width attributes of image.<br>If you don't specify any height or width then the image will be displayed with it actual size.</p>
